## Previewing

There are 2 ways on how to preview and test. One is by simply cloning the repository and putting it in XAMPP's `htdocs`.

And the other one is by cloning the repository, run your MariaDB and Apache instance, configure the database and table needed with the provided SQL query file, and then run this PHP command in your terminal (I assume you have PHP binary installed):

```bash
php -S 127.0.0.1:8080
```

> Open the website with trailing slash, else it won't work.

XAMPP:

```bash
localhost/uts-pweb2/
```

Custom LAMP stack:

```bash
localhost:8080/
```

Passwords for testing:

- irvanmalik48 : `@irvann48_`
- pasha12 and aliftoriq : `tes123`
