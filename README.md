# UTS PWeb 2

This is a repository containing my group's midterm exam assignment. And yeah, that's it. Any suggestions and contributions are welcome.

## Previewing

There are 2 ways on how to preview and test. One is by simply cloning the repository and putting it in XAMPP's `htdocs`.

And the other one is by cloning the repository, run your MariaDB and Apache instance, and then run this PHP command in your terminal (I assume you have PHP binary installed):

```bash
php -S 127.0.0.1:8080
```
